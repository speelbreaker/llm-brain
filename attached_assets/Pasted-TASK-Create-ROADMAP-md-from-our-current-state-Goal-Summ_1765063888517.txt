TASK: Create ROADMAP.md from our current state

Goal:
Summarize our current project status and create a clear, non-technical roadmap for the next phases of the Options Trading Agent.

Please:

1) Read ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md and HEALTHCHECK.md to understand the current state of the project (features, smoke tests, technical debt status).

2) Create a new file at the repo root called:

   ROADMAP.md

Audience:
Me (project owner, non-programmer). Use simple language and keep it high-level.

Structure:
ROADMAP.md should have these sections:

1. Current Status
   - Brief bullet list of what we already have, for example:
     - Live Deribit testnet agent (covered calls) with rule-based and LLM modes
     - Web dashboard (Live Agent / Backtesting Lab / Calibration / Chat)
     - Backtesting engine with synthetic pricing
     - Training data export + LLM training conversion scripts
     - Smoke tests + minimal unit tests in place
   - Mention that P0 technical debt items are fixed and some P1 items (IVRV, expiry parsing, tests) are done.

2. Phase 1 – Stabilize “One Good Bot”
   - Summarize that this is mostly complete.
   - Optionally list a few small polish items (better docs for TRAINING_MODE, presets, etc.) but mark them as optional.

3. Phase 2 – Multi-bot / Multi-strategy Architecture
   - Explain, in non-technical language:
     - We want several strategies (“bots”) that share the same risk engine and data.
     - Examples:
       - Covered calls – conservative
       - Covered calls – aggressive
       - Calls+puts experimental
     - Each strategy has:
       - A name (strategy_id)
       - A risk profile
       - Allowed instruments/actions
       - A policy type (rule-based vs LLM)
     - The agent loop will:
       - Build one market snapshot,
       - Ask each strategy for a proposal,
       - Let the risk engine decide which orders to place.
   - Mention that the Backtesting Lab will also support running/backtesting individual strategies identified by strategy_id and data_version.

4. Phase 3 – LLM “Researcher Mode”
   - Describe the idea:
     - The LLM periodically reads backtest and training metrics and proposes new strategy configurations or parameter sets.
     - These go into an experiment queue.
     - The backtesting engine evaluates them automatically.
     - Good ones can be promoted to real strategies; bad ones are rejected.
   - Emphasize that all experiments go through backtests and risk checks before ever trading.

5. Phase 4 – Real Historical Data (Tardis) and Advanced Training
   - Briefly describe:
     - Integrating Tardis.dev’s Deribit options history as a data source.
     - Using it to train better small models or fine-tune LLM behavior on real skew/vol surfaces.
   - Clearly mark this as a later “R&D phase” that requires a data subscription.

6. Priorities & Next Steps
   - A short list, e.g.:
     - Near-term:
       - Implement multi-strategy support (strategy_id, registry, shared risk engine)
       - Add a basic strategy status table in the Live Agent UI
     - Medium-term:
       - Add a simple researcher job + experiment queue for backtests
     - Long-term:
       - Integrate Tardis historical data
       - Experiment with more complex structures (puts, spreads, butterflies)

Constraints:
- Do not promise features that aren’t feasible with the current architecture.
- Keep it concise and readable (target ~2–3 pages max).
- Use headings and bullet points so I can skim it easily.

Do NOT modify any code in this task; only create ROADMAP.md and, if needed, minimally update ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md to link to the roadmap.
