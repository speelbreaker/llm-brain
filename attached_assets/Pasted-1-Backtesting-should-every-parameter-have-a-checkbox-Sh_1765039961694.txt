1. Backtesting: should every parameter have a checkbox?

Short version:
Yes to toggles, but not for every tiny parameter.
Do toggles for rule families, not raw numbers.

Why not a checkbox for everything?

If you can independently toggle 15+ constraints you get:

A combinatorial explosion of possible configurations.

Very noisy results (you forget what combination produced what backtest).

A UI that feels like the cockpit of a 747.

Better pattern:

High-level scenario presets (radio buttons or dropdown):

Ultra Safe – All risk checks ON, conservative delta/DTE, per-expiry limits enforced.

Balanced – Most risk checks ON, but slightly looser margins, a bit more aggressive delta/DTE.

Aggressive – Looser constraints, per-expiry limits relaxed, more ladders, more positions.

An “Advanced / Override” section with checklists for rule groups, e.g.:

✅ Enforce per-expiry exposure cap

✅ Enforce margin_used_pct limit

✅ Enforce max |net_delta|

✅ Restrict to 1 primary short call per expiry

✅ Require IV/RV ≥ threshold

✅ Use synthetic IV + skew engine

✅ Allow multi-profile laddering (conservative/moderate/aggressive in parallel)

✅ Respect min premium filter

So during backtesting, you say:

“Run the last 6 months with Aggressive preset, but turn off per-expiry cap and 1-call-per-expiry rule and see what happens.”

Or, “Run Ultra Safe but turn off IV/RV filter, just to see the impact.”

That’s flexible but not insane.

2. Exact text for training_rules and live_rules

Below is plug-and-play wording you can drop into your ModeRules:

2.1. Training rules (for training_rules)

Description

training_rules.description = (
    "Training mode on Deribit testnet: let the bot explore, open multiple covered "
    "calls, and gather experience data without putting real capital at risk."
)


Notes – short, human-readable bullets:

training_rules.notes = [
    "Runs on Deribit testnet only. No real capital is used.",
    "Risk checks for margin, per-expiry exposure, and position size are relaxed so the bot can open many trades and learn.",
    "Can open multiple covered calls per underlying and per expiry to build ladders across different strikes and deltas.",
    "Uses all enabled risk profiles (Conservative / Moderate / Aggressive) in parallel for richer training data.",
    "Still respects basic sanity checks: requires valid prices, greeks, and IV/RV data before placing any order.",
    "Uses the same delta and DTE windows as live mode, but is allowed to operate near the edges of those ranges when exploring.",
    "IV/RV filters are applied but can be slightly loosened in training to see behavior in borderline conditions.",
    "Orders are sent with dry_run = False on TESTNET so trades show up as real positions in the Deribit testnet UI.",
]


If you want slightly shorter, you can trim, but that’s the core idea: “relaxed but not insane”.

2.2. Live / normal rules (for live_rules)

Description

live_rules.description = (
    "Normal / live mode: prioritize capital preservation, enforce full risk checks, "
    "and keep the number of open positions manageable."
)


Notes – focused on “real money, strict rules”:

live_rules.notes = [
    "Trades only on the configured network (typically mainnet) and can use real capital when dry_run is disabled.",
    "Enforces full risk engine: margin_used_pct must stay below the configured cap, and |net_delta| must remain within limits.",
    "Per-expiry exposure limit is enforced so a single expiry cannot dominate the portfolio risk.",
    "Restricts the number of open short calls per underlying and expiry to keep the position set simple and easy to manage.",
    "Requires candidates to pass delta and DTE filters before trading (e.g. within the configured delta and days-to-expiry ranges).",
    "Requires IV/RV to be attractive enough before selling premium; if volatility is not juicy, the bot will not trade.",
    "Chooses a single best action per decision tick (no aggressive laddering across multiple profiles in one go).",
    "If any critical risk check fails, the decision is downgraded to DO_NOTHING instead of forcing a trade.",
    "Dry run mode can be enabled for shadow trading on live data; when dry_run = True, all orders are simulated only.",
]

2.3. Optional: show the differences visually

If you want the UI text to highlight contrast, you can add a small line in the card that compares the two:

Training mode: “Relaxed limits, multiple calls and ladders allowed, goal = learn.”

Live mode: “Strict limits, few calls, goal = protect capital.”

But in terms of app internals, the key bits are those description + notes arrays.
