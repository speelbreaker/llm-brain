Goal: In TRAINING MODE on TESTNET, let the bot open MANY covered calls (ladders),
not just one. Right now it sells one call and then does DO_NOTHING, even though
margin and delta are fine.

We already have a "training_mode on testnet: risk checks skipped" path in the
risk engine, but the decision policy is still acting conservatively.

Please implement the following:

1) Central helper
-----------------
Add a helper on the config/settings object:

    def is_training_enabled(self) -> bool:
        """
        Returns True when we are in the special training mode intended for
        Deribit TESTNET experimentation (research/learning).
        """
        # You can base this on existing fields, e.g.:
        # return self.mode == "research" and self.training_mode and self.deribit_env == "testnet"
        ...

We will use this everywhere below.

2) Risk Engine: bypass all exposure limits in training mode on TESTNET
----------------------------------------------------------------------
In the risk check function (e.g. check_action_allowed / run_risk_checks):

- At the very top, BEFORE any per-expiry / per-underlying / margin checks, add:

    if settings.is_training_enabled():
        return RiskCheck(
            allowed=True,
            reasons=["training_mode on testnet: risk checks skipped"]
        )

- This must skip:
    - per-expiry exposure limits (e.g. max_per_expiry_exposure = 0.10),
    - total positions count limits,
    - any "has too many calls open" style checks.

On MAINNET or when is_training_enabled() is False, the risk logic must behave
exactly as it does today.

3) Policy layer: don't block new calls in training mode
-------------------------------------------------------
Find the logic that decides DO_NOTHING when there is already a call in the
same expiry or when per-expiry exposure is high. Typical patterns might be:

    if has_open_call_for(underlying, expiry):
        return DO_NOTHING, "already have call for this expiry"

    if per_expiry_exposure >= settings.max_per_expiry_exposure:
        return DO_NOTHING, "per-expiry exposure exceeded"

Wrap such checks so that THEY ONLY APPLY when NOT in training mode.

For example, change:

    if per_expiry_exposure >= settings.max_per_expiry_exposure:
        return DO_NOTHING, "per-expiry exposure exceeded"

to:

    if (not settings.is_training_enabled()
        and per_expiry_exposure >= settings.max_per_expiry_exposure):
        return DO_NOTHING, "per-expiry exposure exceeded"

And change:

    if has_open_call_for(underlying, expiry):
        return DO_NOTHING, "already have call for this expiry"

to:

    if (not settings.is_training_enabled()
        and has_open_call_for(underlying, expiry)):
        return DO_NOTHING, "already have call for this expiry"

The idea: in training mode, having an existing call must NOT be a reason to do nothing.

4) Allow multiple calls per underlying in training mode
-------------------------------------------------------
If there is a "max_positions_per_underlying" or equivalent limit on the
decision side, gate it the same way:

    if (not settings.is_training_enabled()
        and positions_for_underlying >= settings.max_positions_per_underlying):
        return DO_NOTHING, "max positions per underlying reached"

This way, training mode is free to open many positions (we still log exposure,
P&L etc., but we don't prevent the trade).

5) Keep "explore" behavior but more active in training mode (optional)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
If there is an exploration wrapper (policy_version = "rb_v1_explore", explore_prob, etc.),
please ensure that in training mode:

- explore_prob is effectively higher (e.g. 0.75–1.0) so more candidates are tried.
- The bot is not artificially limited to at most one candidate per run because
  of "we already opened a call here" policy reasons (those should be covered
  by steps 3 and 4).

Summary:
- On TESTNET + training_mode, risk engine always returns allowed=True.
- On TESTNET + training_mode, the policy must NOT block additional calls due to
  existing positions or per-expiry exposure caps.
- On MAINNET or when training_mode is off, behavior must remain exactly as it is now.
